                start
                the journey together.What makes night sky photography so appealing? Is it the hues? Is it the sheer
                number
                of
                stars? Part of it is surely because a long exposure of the night sky is something the naked eye does not
                see.

            <h2>Become a photograher</h2>
            <p>You need to read, study great photographs and experiment with various techniques that professional
                photographers talk about. One of the keys to better composition is to avoid putting the primary focus of
                your picture in the center.On most digital and iPhone cameras, you will find 2 parallel horizontal lines
                and 2 vertical parallel lines. They divide the picture into 9 segments.
                When you focus your camera on the primary image, don’t put it in the center– move it into one of the
                other segments. This simple technique will let you frame more intriguing captures.</p>
