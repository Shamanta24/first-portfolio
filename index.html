            <p> you might see many thrilling pictures but now lets take it ownself. make the photo memorable one. let's
                start
                the journey together.What makes night sky photography so appealing? Is it the hues? Is it the sheer
                number
                of
                stars? Part of it is surely because a long exposure of the night sky is something the naked eye does not
                see.
                The possibility of photographing something like that is, in its
                elf,bring it more.</p>

            <h2>Become a photograher</h2>
            <p>You need to read, study great photographs and experiment with various techniques that professional
                photographers talk about. One of the keys to better composition is to avoid putting the primary focus of
                your picture in the center.On most digital and iPhone cameras, you will find 2 parallel horizontal lines
                and 2 vertical parallel lines. They divide the picture into 9 segments.
                When you focus your camera on the primary image, don’t put it in the center– move it into one of the
                other segments. This simple technique will let you frame more intriguing captures.</p>

                    cost a lot to adopt her: forty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a litterbox, food, and dishes
                    for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home with me she got taken to the pound by the animal

                    a leash. Anyway, my cat is my best friend. I'm glad I got her. She sleeps under the covers with me
                    when it's cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the middle of the night and wakes me up, though.
